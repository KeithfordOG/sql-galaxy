I'm a passionate developer with a love for data and all things SQL. I created **SQL Galaxy** to help both beginners and seasoned developers improve their SQL skills through interactive challenges inspired by space exploration.

As a developer aiming to become proficient in full stack development, SQL and data management are essential tools in my toolkit. Through this project, I hope to inspire others to enjoy the problem-solving aspect of SQL while learning the key concepts in a fun and engaging way.

# Project Purpose Section
st.header("What is SQL Galaxy?")
st.write("""
**SQL Galaxy** is an interactive game designed to enhance SQL learning by offering challenges of increasing difficulty, from basic queries to advanced subqueries and joins. The idea is simple: you solve SQL problems to navigate through different galaxies and levels.

Each query represents a learning opportunity, with explanations and solutions provided for each step. The game covers fundamental SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and `WHERE`, and progresses into more complex concepts like `CTEs` and `subqueries`.
